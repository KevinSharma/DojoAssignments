Welcome! If you are new to the game, here are some tips:

Look at your surroundings with the command "ls".
Move to a new location with the command "cd LOCATION"
You can backtrack with the command "cd ..".
Interact with things in the world with the command "less ITEM"

If you forget where you are, type "pwd"

Go ahead, explore. We hope you enjoy what you find. Do ls as your first command.
